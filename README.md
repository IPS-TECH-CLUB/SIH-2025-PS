# 🚀 SIH Problem Statements Hub  

Welcome fam 👋 This is the **one-stop repo** for all **Smart India Hackathon problem statements** for our college community.  
Think of it as our **SIH playground** 🏟️ — where you can browse PS, claim them, and vibe with ideas together.

3. **Claim a Problem Statement**  
   - Head to **Issues** tab → click **New Issue**  
   - Title it like:  
     ```
     PS001 – AI for Healthcare
     ```  
   - In the description, just mention:  
     - Your **Team Name / Members**  
     - Why you’re picking it (optional but cool 😎)  

   - Once done → you’ve officially claimed it. 🎉  

4. **Rules for Claims**  
   - 1 team = max **2 problem statements**  
   - Dupes are fine (multiple teams can explore the same PS)  

5. **Discuss & Ideate**  
   - Use the **Discussions** tab to throw ideas, ask doubts, brainstorm 🔥  
   - Don’t be shy — collab >>> competition
