# 📱 Travel Data Collection App  
### Problem Statement ID: 25082  

## 📌 Title  
Development of a travel-related software app that captures trip information via mobile devices  

---

## 📝 Description  
Accurate **transportation data collection** is a major challenge for planners at **NATPAC**. Traditional methods like manual household surveys are:  
- Time-consuming  
- Cover only a small percentage of the population  
- Insufficient for robust transport planning  

To address this, NATPAC requires the development of a **mobile application** that can capture **trip-related information** directly from users.  

### 🚦 Required Features  
The app should:  
- Capture key trip details:  
  - Trip number  
  - Origin & destination  
  - Departure time & mode of travel  
  - Trip chain (linked activities)  
- Optionally capture details of **accompanying travelers**  
- Obtain **user consent** for data collection  
- Use a mix of **automatic detection** (e.g., GPS, time stamps, travel mode inference) and **user input nudges** for missing details  
- Store all trip data securely on a **server/database** accessible to NATPAC scientists  

---

## ⚠️ Current Challenges  
- Manual surveys are **slow and resource-intensive**  
- Data coverage is **inadequate for statewide planning**  
- Lack of real-time, continuous, and large-scale data  
- Existing methods fail to establish **complete trip chains**  

---

## 🎯 Expected Solution Impact  
- Enable **scalable, accurate, and continuous** travel data collection  
- Provide **rich datasets** for transportation planning & policy-making  
- Improve understanding of **trip chains and mobility patterns**  
- Reduce dependence on **manual surveys**  
- Facilitate **evidence-based transport infrastructure planning**
