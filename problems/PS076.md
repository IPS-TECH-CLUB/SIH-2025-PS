# PS25076 – AI-Based Farmer Query Support and Advisory System

## Problem
Farmers often face critical questions related to pests, weather, inputs, subsidies, and market trends—but timely expert advice is rarely accessible. Agri officers and helplines are overburdened, and existing services don’t scale to support individual needs across diverse regions, languages, and literacy levels.

## Challenge
Build an AI-powered advisory system that allows farmers to ask queries in their own language (preferably Malayalam) and receive accurate, context-aware answers instantly.

## Core Features
1. **Natural Language Query Handling:** Farmers can ask questions via voice or text in Malayalam—e.g., “Which pesticide for leaf spot in my banana?”  
2. **Multimodal Inputs:** Support for image uploads (e.g., diseased crop photo) or voice notes.  
3. **AI-Powered Knowledge Engine:** Use LLMs and fine-tuned agri datasets to provide reliable, tailored answers—drawing from local crop calendars, pest advisories, weather, and scheme guidelines.  
4. **Context Awareness:** Factor in the farmer’s location, crop, season, and history (if known) to give personalized advice.  
5. **Escalation System:** For complex or unclear queries, escalate to local agri officers with context and suggestions.  
6. **Learning Loop:** Continuously improve the system using real queries, feedback, and local expert inputs.

## Expected Impact
- Makes expert-level farming advice instantly accessible to all.  
- Bridges the communication gap between farmers and extension systems.  
- Supports Krishibhavans and Agri Departments by automating first-level support.  

This system aims to become a “Digital Krishi Officer”—always available, always learning, and always farmer-first.
