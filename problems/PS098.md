# 🏢 BIM-Integrated 4-Story Commercial Office Building Design  
### Problem Statement ID: 25098  

---

## 📌 Title  
Design and Develop a 4-Story Commercial Office Building using Revit Architecture & Revit Structure  

---

## 📝 Problem Description  
Students are tasked with designing a **4-story commercial office building** by effectively integrating **architectural and structural models** within a **BIM (Building Information Modeling) environment**.  

The challenge requires:  
- A **clash-free BIM model** that ensures coordination between Architecture & Structure.  
- Deliverables suitable for **MEP design, quantity take-off, and construction documentation**.  
- High-quality **2D drawings, 3D renderings, and walkthrough presentation**.  

---

## 📐 Requirements & Specifications  
- **Software Tools**: Revit Architecture, Revit Structure  
- **Assumptions Allowed**:  
  - Plot size  
  - Dimensions (all in mm units)  
- **Modeling Requirements**:  
  - Beams, Columns, Slabs, Stairs, Tile Flooring  
  - Coordinated Architecture + Structure model  
  - Clash-free integration for MEP readiness  
- **Deliverables**:  
  1. **BIM Model** (4-story office building)  
  2. **2D Structural Drawings** – Beams, Columns, Slabs (with detailing)  
  3. **High-Quality Rendering** of the building  
  4. **30-second Walkthrough Presentation**  

---

## 🎯 Expected Solution  
- A **coordinated BIM model** with no architectural-structural clashes  
- Generation of **2D working drawings** for structural elements  
- High-quality **visualization and rendering** of the office building  
- A **walkthrough video** to showcase the design intent  
- A design framework that can be extended for **MEP, cost estimation, and construction documents**  

---

## 🌍 Impact & Benefits  
- Promotes **BIM adoption in academia**  
- Helps students practice **integrated project delivery (IPD)** workflows  
- Demonstrates how **clash detection** reduces cost overruns in real projects  
- Enhances employability skills in **AEC industry standard tools (Revit, BIM)**
