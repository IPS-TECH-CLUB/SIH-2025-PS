## 📌 Title  
AI-based Drop-out Prediction and Counseling System  

---

## 📝 Background  
In many public institutes, **student struggles are identified too late**:  
- By the time **term-end marks** reveal failures, students are already disengaged.  
- Attendance, test scores, and fee payment records exist in **separate silos** (different spreadsheets).  
- Mentors have **no unified view** to spot students slipping in multiple areas simultaneously.  

While commercial analytics platforms offer predictive insights, they:  
- Demand **high budgets**  
- Require **complex setup & maintenance**  
- Are **out of reach** for resource-constrained institutes  

Thus, a **lightweight, transparent, and educator-friendly solution** is needed.  

---

## 🚧 Challenges  
- Fragmented data sources (attendance, assessments, fees, etc.)  
- No early-warning system for **at-risk students**  
- Lack of affordability for advanced commercial platforms  
- Educators need **assistive, not replacement** tools  
- Minimal training should be required for faculty  

---

## 🎯 Objective  
Develop a **unified digital dashboard** that:  
1. Consolidates student data (attendance, scores, fee records, etc.)  
2. Uses **clear thresholds** + **machine learning** to flag at-risk students early  
3. Presents risk insights in **simple, color-coded visuals**  
4. Sends **scheduled notifications** to mentors & guardians  
5. Requires **minimal setup and training**  
6. Is **cost-effective and sustainable** for public institutes

## 💡 Expected Solution  
- **Data Ingestion**  
  - Import from spreadsheets (CSV, XLSX) automatically  
  - Merge student data into a **single view**  

- **Risk Prediction Engine**  
  - Apply **rule-based thresholds** (e.g., < 60% attendance, > 3 failed attempts, declining test scores)  
  - Augment with **ML models** to refine early detection  
  - Classify students into **Low / Medium / High Risk** categories  

- **Dashboard Features**  
  - Simple **traffic light visualization** (Green = Safe, Yellow = At Risk, Red = Critical)  
  - Individual student profiles with history & trends  
  - Institution-level overview of risk distribution  

- **Notification System**  
  - Automated alerts to mentors and guardians via **email / SMS / WhatsApp API**  
  - Predictable schedule (weekly / monthly)  

- **Counseling Support**  
  - Provide **recommendations** for intervention (extra classes, parent meeting, counseling session)  
  - Track follow-up actions

## 🛠️ Key Features to Build  
1. **Unified Data Layer**  
   - ETL pipeline to merge spreadsheets into a structured DB  

2. **Prediction & Rules Engine**  
   - ML model (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) for dropout risk  
   - Rule-based thresholds for explainability  

3. **Visual Dashboard**  
   - Web-based dashboard for mentors/admins  
   - Student heatmap for quick scanning  
   - Drill-down reports per student  

4. **Automated Alerts**  
   - Weekly risk reports to faculty/parents  
   - SMS/Email/WhatsApp notifications  

5. **Lightweight & Scalable**  
   - Runs on low-cost servers or institute PCs  
   - Minimal training required  

---

## 🌍 Impact & Benefits  
- **Early intervention** → Prevents student dropouts  
- **Empowers educators** with data-driven insights  
- **Low-cost solution** → Public institutes can adopt easily  
- **Improves student success rates** by enabling timely support  
- Builds a **culture of proactive mentoring** rather than reactive damage control
