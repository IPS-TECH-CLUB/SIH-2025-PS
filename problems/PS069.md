# PS25069 – AI-Driven Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) Tool for Advancing Circularity and Sustainability in Metallurgy and Mining

## Background
As industries increasingly emphasize sustainability, **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** is emerging not just as a tool for measuring environmental impact, but as a key strategy for advancing circularity. Metals like aluminium and copper, vital to sectors from energy to infrastructure, undergo multiple stages — from extraction and processing to use and end-of-life. Traditional linear models often result in resource depletion and waste. Modern LCA frameworks now assess not only emissions and resource use, but also the potential for reuse, recycling, and closed-loop systems. By informing decisions on product design, manufacturing, and end-of-life recovery, LCA enables a shift toward a circular economy where materials are kept in use longer and waste is minimized.
