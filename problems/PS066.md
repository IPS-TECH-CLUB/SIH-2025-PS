# PS25066 â€“ Development of an AI-driven ChatBOT for INGRES as a Virtual Assistant

## Background
The Assessment of Dynamic Ground Water Resources of India is conducted annually by the **Central Ground Water Board (CGWB)** and State/UT Ground Water Departments, under the coordination of the **Central Level Expert Group (CLEG), DoWR, RD & GR, MoJS**. The assessment uses a GIS-based web application named **INGRES (India Ground Water Resource Estimation System)**, developed by CGWB and IIT Hyderabad ([https://ingres.iith.ac.in/home](https://ingres.iith.ac.in/home)).

The process estimates annual groundwater recharge, extractable resources, total extraction, and the stage of groundwater extraction for each assessment unit (Block/Mandal/Taluk). Units are categorized as Safe, Semi-Critical, Critical, or Over-Exploited, forming the scientific basis for groundwater management and regulation.

## Proposed Solution
To improve accessibility, it is proposed to develop an **AI-driven ChatBOT for INGRES**. This intelligent virtual assistant will enable users to easily query groundwater data, access historical and current assessments, and obtain instant insights without navigating complex datasets.

### Key Features
- Intelligent query handling for groundwater estimation data  
- Real-time access to current and historical assessment results  
- Interactive scientific diagrams and visualizations  
- Multilingual support, including Indian regional languages  
- Seamless integration with the INGRES database for quick information retrieval  

### Impact
- Enhances user engagement and simplifies access to groundwater resource data  
- Supports informed decision-making for planners, researchers, policymakers, and the general public  
- Makes the INGRES portal more user-friendly, accessible, and effective in disseminating groundwater information
