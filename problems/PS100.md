## 📌 Title  
Accelerating High-Fidelity Road Network Modeling for Indian Traffic Simulations  

---

## 📝 Problem Description  
Urban traffic congestion in India is worsened by the **limitations of existing urban planning software**, which typically assumes smooth, ideal road conditions found in developed countries.  

In reality, Indian road networks are highly **unpredictable and complex**, with challenges such as:  
- Potholes and degraded road surfaces  
- Temporary barricades & partial lane closures  
- Ongoing construction activities  
- Erratic and hyper-local driver behaviors  

**Manual modeling** of such features into digital twins for simulation is:  
- Tedious  
- Time-consuming  
- Engineering-intensive  

Thus, there is a need for **accelerated workflows, templates, and toolsets** to quickly build realistic digital twins of Indian road networks and junctions.

- Simplifies the **creation of high-fidelity road models**  
- Incorporates **typical Indian traffic nuances**  
- Seamlessly integrates with **MATLAB/Simulink simulation workflows**  
- Empowers agencies to run **realistic traffic simulations** for:  
  - Crisis handling
