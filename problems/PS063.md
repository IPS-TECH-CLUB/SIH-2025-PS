# PS25063 â€“ Developing a Cost Effective Solution for Detecting the Breakage of Low Voltage AC Distribution Over Head Conductors

## Background
A cost-effective solution is required for detecting the breakage of Low Voltage AC Distribution Over Head conductors to isolate the source of supply, prevent hazardous electric shock scenarios to the public, and send alarms to the concerned section office for immediate fault rectification.

Recently, several cases of accidental deaths of children and adults due to electrocution from broken live conductors lying on the ground were reported in Kerala. Low voltage distribution lines often snap due to falling trees during natural calamities and also due to aging or corrosion. This dangerous condition is not detected or isolated by upstream fuses in these feeders because of high earth resistance and low fault current, leading to electrocution deaths when people come into contact with live bare conductors. Many existing solutions identified so far are not cost-effective or viable for the vast distribution network.

## Expected Solution
An innovative solution based on **IoT and AI**, including **edge intelligence**, may provide an economical and scalable solution for this socially relevant problem faced by KSEBL.

### Key Features (Suggested)
- Real-time monitoring of LV AC overhead conductors.  
- Automatic detection of conductor breakage using IoT sensors.  
- Edge AI processing to reduce response latency.  
- Alerts to section offices via mobile or cloud dashboard.  
- Cost-effective and scalable for large distribution networks.  

### Impact
- Prevents accidental electrocution deaths.  
- Ensures faster fault rectification and grid safety.  
- Cost-efficient solution for wide-area deployment.
