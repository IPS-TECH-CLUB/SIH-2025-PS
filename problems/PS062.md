# PS25062 – Implementation of Smart Agriculture for Efficient Cultivation in Hilly Regions

## Background
The agricultural region of Jorethang in South Sikkim experiences harsh, rainless summers and frequent water scarcity, making traditional irrigation unreliable and inefficient. Farmers struggle to provide adequate water to crops, often leading to reduced yields and wasted resources. With climate change intensifying these issues, there's a pressing need for a sustainable, smart irrigation approach that maximizes water efficiency and crop productivity. Integrating rainwater harvesting, sensor-based monitoring, and crop-specific intelligence offers a forward-thinking solution to these regional challenges.

## Proposed Solution
**AgroSmart: A Sensor-Based Smart Irrigation System with Crop Intelligence and Rainwater Harvesting**

This system aims to provide affordable, automated irrigation tailored to each crop’s needs using soil moisture and environmental sensors. It integrates a rainwater harvesting unit with real-time water level monitoring, ensuring efficient water use even during dry periods.

### Key Features
- **Soil Sensors:** Moisture and temperature sensors to monitor field conditions.  
- **Crop Database:** Determines optimal watering levels for different crops.  
- **Automated Valve Control:** Managed via microcontrollers (Arduino/ESP32).  
- **Rainwater Harvesting:** Level sensors to track available water.  
- **Dashboard:** Mobile/web interface for monitoring and remote control of irrigation.  
- **Alerts & Notifications:** SMS or app updates to keep farmers informed.  

### Impact
- Conserves water and minimizes wastage.  
- Improves crop yields.  
- Reduces manual labor.  
- Helps farmers in Jorethang adapt to climate variability with a self-sustaining, smart irrigation system.
