# PS25079 â€“ Software to Detect and Turn Off LT Lines when Broken

## Problem
Software other than a circuit breaker that can be used to detect and turn off LT (Low Tension) lines when the line breaks.

## Proposed Solution
Develop a software-based monitoring and control system that can detect faults in LT lines and automatically disconnect power to prevent hazards, without relying solely on physical circuit breakers.

## Expected Impact
- Reduces electrocution and fire risks due to broken LT lines.  
- Enables faster response and mitigation of electrical hazards.  
- Supports safer and more reliable power distribution networks.
