# PS25080 – Document Overload at Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) – An Automated Solution

## Background
Since its first commercial run in 2017, KMRL has grown into a complex, multidisciplinary enterprise beyond train operations. Every business day, KMRL generates and receives thousands of pages of material: engineering drawings, maintenance job cards, incident reports, vendor invoices, purchase-order correspondence, regulatory directives, environmental-impact studies, safety circulars, HR policies, legal opinions, and board-meeting minutes.  

These documents arrive via email, Maximo exports, SharePoint, WhatsApp PDFs, hard-copy scans, and cloud links—in English, Malayalam, or bilingual formats—often with tables, photos, or signatures. The diversity and volume have created significant challenges:

- **Information latency:** Managers spend hours skimming documents for actionable lines, delaying decisions on train availability, contractor payments, or staffing.  
- **Siloed awareness:** Departments operate without full visibility, causing overlapping or missed actions.  
- **Compliance exposure:** Critical regulatory updates risk being overlooked.  
- **Knowledge attrition:** Insights vanish when personnel transfer or retire.  
- **Duplicated effort:** Teams create redundant summaries or slide decks, multiplying manual work.

As KMRL expands corridors, adds depots, and integrates emerging technologies like Unified Namespace (UNS) and IoT condition monitoring, the documentary burden will intensify.  

## Proposed Solution
Develop an automated document management system that:

- Condenses and contextualizes documents.
- Routes critical information to relevant stakeholders.
- Preserves traceability to original sources.
- Provides rapid, trustworthy snapshots for decision-making.

## Expected Impact
- Faster cross-department coordination.  
- Strengthened regulatory compliance.  
- Safeguarded institutional knowledge.  
- Reduced operational delays and costs.  
- Enhanced passenger-centric service delivery.
