# Intelligent Periodic Sprinkling System with Remote Control and Monitoring
**Domain:** Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development  
**Problem Code:** SIH25014  
**Description:** Problem Description

Urban local bodies struggle with improper waste segregation at the household level, leading to inefficiencies in waste processing and increased landfill burden. Despite awareness campaigns, compliance remains low due to lack of monitoring and feedback mechanisms. This issue is widespread in urban areas with high waste generation.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Improper segregation affects nearly 70% of urban waste management systems, increasing recycling costs and environmental pollution. A solution would improve waste processing efficiency and reduce landfill dependency.

Expected Outcomes

• IoT-based system or mobile app to monitor segregation at collection points.
• Provide real-time feedback to households on compliance.
• Generate compliance reports for local authorities to enforce better waste management.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Urban local bodies
• Residents
• Waste management agencies
• Environmental organizations
