# 🎓 AI-Based Timetable Generation System  
### Problem Statement ID: 25091  

## 📌 Title  
AI-Based Timetable Generation System aligned with NEP 2020 for Multidisciplinary Education Structures  

---

## 📝 Background  
With the rollout of the **National Education Policy (NEP) 2020**, higher education institutions—including **Institutes of Teacher Education** and general degree colleges—have shifted to:  
- **Four-Year Undergraduate Programmes (FYUP)**  
- Integrated teacher education programs (B.Ed., M.Ed., ITEP)  

These new programs emphasize **flexible, credit-based, multidisciplinary structures**, where students can choose from:  
- Major & Minor courses  
- Skill-Based courses  
- Ability Enhancement courses  
- Value-Added courses  

📌 **The Challenge**:  
Manual timetable creation under this framework is extremely complex due to:  
- Numerous subject combinations  
- Variable credit hours  
- Student preferences  
- Faculty workload distribution  

Despite dedicated committees, issues like **clashes, faculty underutilization, and inefficiencies** persist.

## 📝 Problem Description  
The goal is to develop a **web-based or hybrid intelligent system** that generates **automated, conflict-free, and optimized timetables** aligned with NEP 2020.  

### 🔗 System Requirements  
The solution must integrate:  
- ✅ **Student data** (elective choices, enrolled credits)  
- ✅ **Curriculum structure** (course codes, credits, theory/practical split)  
- ✅ **Faculty workload** (availability, expertise)  
- ✅ **Room/Lab availability & capacity**  
- ✅ **Teaching practice schedules** (for B.Ed., M.Ed.)  
- ✅ **Fieldwork, internships & project timelines**  

### 🔧 Functional Features  
- Dynamic editing & scenario simulation  
- Scalability for upcoming semesters  
- Real-time inputs & updates through an **admin interface**  
- Multi-program support (B.Ed., M.Ed., FYUP, ITEP)  

---

## 🎯 Expected Solution  
An **AI/ML-assisted Timetable Generator** that can:  
- Accept structured inputs from academic, student & faculty databases  
- Generate **semester-wise timetables** without conflicts  
- Optimize faculty utilization and resource allocation  
- Support **future course additions** and changing NEP guidelines  
- Export timetables in **PDF/Excel formats** for sharing  
- Integrate with existing **Academic Management Systems**  

---

## ✅ Expected Impact  
- Simplifies complex timetable creation under **multidisciplinary NEP structures**  
- Ensures **conflict-free scheduling** across faculty, classrooms, and labs  
- Improves **resource utilization & efficiency**  
- Provides **scalable, adaptable solutions** for future curriculum changes  
- Enhances academic experience for both students & faculty
