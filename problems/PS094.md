## 📝 Background  
The decline in **student enrollment in government degree colleges** is not due to lack of infrastructure or teaching resources but rather a **critical gap in awareness**.  

Students (and often parents) are unclear about:  
- Which subject stream (Arts, Science, Commerce, Vocational) to choose after Class 10/12  
- Degree programs available in nearby government colleges  
- Job opportunities or higher education options after graduation  
- The value of pursuing graduation compared to short-term skill-based courses  

This lack of clarity results in poor academic decisions, dropouts, and migration to private institutions.
