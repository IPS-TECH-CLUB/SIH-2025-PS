# 🌍 AI-powered FRA Atlas & WebGIS Decision Support System (DSS)

### Problem Statement ID: 101  
### SIH Code: SIH12508

## 📝 Title  
**Development of AI-powered FRA Atlas and WebGIS-based Decision Support System (DSS) for Integrated Monitoring of Forest Rights Act (FRA) Implementation.**  

---

## 📌 Background  
The **Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006** aims to recognize and vest forest rights in forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers.  
- FRA implementation is complex, involving **land claims, approvals, rejections, mapping, and monitoring**.  
- Currently, data is scattered across **state records, paper-based claims, GIS layers, and manual processes**.  
- There is **limited real-time visibility** for decision-makers, resulting in delays, duplication, and governance gaps.  

---

## 🚧 Challenges  
1. **Data Integration** – FRA claim data exists in multiple formats (manual records, state portals, GIS shapefiles).  
2. **Verification & Monitoring** – Manual verification of land claims is **slow, error-prone, and opaque**.  
3. **Geospatial Analysis** – Mapping claimed areas, overlaps with forest boundaries, and land-use changes requires **advanced GIS + AI support**.  
4. **Accessibility** – Need for **state-wise dashboards** for Madhya Pradesh, Tripura, Odisha, Telangana.  
5. **Transparency & Compliance** – Ensuring FRA rules are followed while enabling better decision-making.  

---

## 🎯 Objective  
Develop an **AI-powered FRA Atlas & WebGIS-based DSS** that:  
1. **Digitizes FRA claim data** (approved, rejected, pending).  
2. Integrates **GIS mapping layers** (forests, villages, land parcels).  
3. Uses **AI/ML** to detect anomalies, overlaps, and land classification.  
4. Provides **real-time dashboards** for ministries, state govts, and local bodies.  
5. Generates **insightful analytics** for policy and governance.  

---

## 💡 Expected Solution  
- **AI-Powered FRA Atlas**  
  - Interactive maps showing **FRA claims, status, and boundaries**.  
  - AI models for detecting **land-use change (via satellite imagery)**.  
  - Automated alerts for **duplicate/overlapping claims**.  

- **WebGIS DSS Features**  
  - Multi-layered GIS platform (villages, forests, claims, administrative boundaries).  
  - Role-based dashboards for **MoTA, state governments, district collectors, Gram Sabhas**.  
  - Decision-support tools for **claim verification, approval tracking, and monitoring**.  

- **Analytics & Reporting**  
  - Status of claims (approved, rejected, pending) with drill-downs.  
  - Geospatial statistics: **area covered, demographic splits, timelines**.  
  - Predictive models: Expected claim approvals based on historical patterns.  

---

## 🛠️ Suggested Tech Stack  
- **Programming Languages:** Python, JavaScript (Node.js, React)  
- **WebGIS:** Leaflet.js, OpenLayers, Mapbox, GeoServer, QGIS integration  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL + PostGIS for spatial data  
- **AI/ML Models:**  
  - Remote sensing (satellite image classification using CNNs)  
  - Duplicate claim detection (clustering, anomaly detection)  
- **Dashboards:** React + D3.js / Plotly for visual analytics  
- **Cloud Deployment:** AWS / GCP / NIC Cloud  

---

## 🚀 Key Features to Build  
1. **FRA Claim Management** – Centralized database of claims & statuses  
2. **AI for Satellite Imagery** – Automatic detection of forest cover change  
3. **Geospatial Mapping** – FRA boundaries overlaid on forest & village maps  
4. **Decision Support Dashboards** – Real-time monitoring by officials  
5. **Transparency Layer** – Public access portal for Gram Sabhas & citizens  

---

## 🌍 Impact & Benefits  
- Strengthens **FRA implementation monitoring** across states  
- Increases **transparency, efficiency, and accountability**  
- Helps policymakers with **real-time data-driven insights**  
- Supports **tribal welfare and rights recognition**  
- Creates a **replicable model** for nationwide FRA monitoring  

---

## 🏢 Organization Details  
- **Organization:** Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA)  
- **Department:** MoTA – FRA Division  
- **Category:** Software  
- **Theme:** Miscellaneous  
- **States of Focus:** Madhya Pradesh, Tripura, Odisha, Telangana
