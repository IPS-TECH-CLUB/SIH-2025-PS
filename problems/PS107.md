# 🎨 Kolam Design Generator  
### Problem Statement ID: 25107  

---

## 📌 Title  
Develop computer programs (in any language, preferably Python) to identify the design principles behind the Kolam designs and recreate the kolams.  

---

## 📝 Background  
Kolams (also called **Muggu, Rangoli, Rangavalli**) are an **ancient Indian cultural tradition** blending:  
- **Art & aesthetics**  
- **Mathematical reasoning** (symmetry, repetition, fractals)  
- **Spatial patterns on dot grids**  

Kolam designs:  
- Drawn using **dot grids** as base reference  
- Follow rules of **symmetry, repetition, connectivity**  
- Are region-specific, with **rich cultural diversity**  

---

## 🚧 Challenges  
- Formalizing the **rules of Kolam creation** into algorithms  
- Identifying **design principles** from existing Kolam datasets  
- Capturing **symmetry (rotational, reflectional), recursion, repetition**  
- Reproducing **authentic-looking designs** computationally  
- Ensuring outputs respect **heritage aesthetics** while being mathematically generated  

---

## 🎯 Objective  
Build **computer programs (preferably in Python)** that:  
1. Identify the **mathematical & design principles** behind Kolam patterns  
2. Recreate Kolams **programmatically** on a grid of dots  
3. Allow **customizations** (grid size, symmetry type, colors, complexity)  
4. Generate **new Kolam variations** inspired by traditional principles  
5. Optionally, provide an **interactive UI** for users to generate/draw Kolams  

---

## 💡 Expected Solution  
- **Kolam Analysis**  
  - Study existing Kolam patterns  
  - Extract principles: grid size, dot arrangements, curve rules, symmetry types  

- **Kolam Generator (Algorithmic)**  
  - Input: Grid size (NxN dots)  
  - Apply symmetry & connection rules  
  - Draw Kolams using computational geometry  

- **Mathematical Techniques**  
  - Graph theory → Treat dot connections as edges  
  - L-systems / Recursive patterns → Capture repetitive nature  
  - Symmetry operations → Rotational/reflectional symmetry  

- **Visualization**  
  - Render designs using Python (Matplotlib, Turtle, Pygame, Tkinter)  
  - Export as **images / SVGs / interactive UI**  

- **Extensions**  
  - Auto-generate **novel patterns** by tweaking symmetry rules  
  - Add **color filling** for aesthetic rangoli-style designs  
  - Mobile/web app for **heritage education**  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Suggested)  
- **Programming Language:** Python (preferred), but open to others (C++, JavaScript)  
- **Libraries for Visualization:**  
  - `matplotlib` / `turtle` → Drawing curves  
  - `pygame` → Interactive UI  
  - `shapely`, `networkx` → Mathematical graph/symmetry handling  
- **Data:**  
  - Sample Kolam patterns (datasets from research papers or hand-curated)  
- **Optional:**  
  - Web interface using Flask/Streamlit  
  - SVG export for scalable cultural artwork

## 🚀 Key Features to Build  
1. **Kolam Dot Grid Generator** – Flexible dot placements (NxN grid, triangular grid, etc.)  
2. **Kolam Pattern Rules** – Apply line/curve drawing principles (around dots, connecting dots)  
3. **Symmetry Handling** – Rotational, reflectional, translational  
4. **Pattern Recreation** – Ability to replicate **existing Kolams** from dataset  
5. **Novel Design Generation** – Generate new Kolams via algorithmic creativity  
6. **UI/Visualization** – Simple interface for rendering, saving, and coloring designs
