# 🚇 AI-Driven Train Induction Planning & Scheduling  
### Problem Statement ID: 25081  

## 📌 Title  
AI-Driven Train Induction Planning & Scheduling for Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL)  

---

## 📝 Description  
Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) faces the nightly challenge of deciding which of its **25 four-car trainsets** should:  
- Enter revenue service at dawn  
- Remain on standby  
- Be held back in the Inspection Bay Line (IBL) for maintenance  

Currently, this complex decision-making process depends on six inter-dependent variables:  

1. **Fitness Certificates** – Validity from Rolling-Stock, Signalling & Telecom departments  
2. **Job-Card Status** – Work orders (open/closed) from IBM Maximo  
3. **Branding Priorities** – Exterior wrap exposure commitments  
4. **Mileage Balancing** – Equal distribution of kilometres to manage component wear  
5. **Cleaning & Detailing Slots** – Manpower and bay availability for interior cleaning  
6. **Stabling Geometry** – Bay positions that reduce shunting and turnaround time  

### ⚠️ Current Challenges  
- Data is spread across spreadsheets, logbooks, and WhatsApp updates  
- Supervisors reconcile all inputs manually between **21:00–23:00 IST**  
- The process is **opaque, error-prone, and non-repeatable**  

**Consequences of errors include:**  
- Train withdrawals from missing telecom clearances → Punctuality KPI failures  
- Uneven mileage → Increased maintenance costs  
- Missed branding targets → Advertiser SLA penalties  
- Excessive shunting → Higher energy use & safety risks  

With fleet expansion to **40 trainsets and two depots by 2027**, the manual workflow is **unsustainable**.

## 🎯 Required Solution  
KMRL seeks an **integrated, AI-driven decision-support platform** to:  

- 🔗 **Ingest heterogeneous data inputs** (Maximo, IoT sensors, UNS streams, manual overrides) in real-time  
- ⚖️ **Apply rule-based constraints & multi-objective optimisation** (service readiness, reliability, cost, branding)  
- 📊 **Generate ranked induction lists** with explainable reasoning, conflict alerts & “what-if” simulations  
- 🤖 **Continuously learn via ML feedback loops** to improve forecasts over time  

---

## ✅ Expected Impact  
- Reproducible, auditable, **data-driven induction planning**  
- Improved **fleet availability & reliability**  
- Reduced **lifecycle cost & component fatigue**  
- SLA compliance with advertisers  
- Safer, more efficient depot operations  
- Enhanced **passenger experience**  
- Staff freed from routine reconciliation to focus on **strategic decisions**
