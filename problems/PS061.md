# PS25061 – Digitize and Showcase Monasteries of Sikkim for Tourism and Cultural Preservation

## Background
Sikkim is home to over 200 monasteries, many of which date back to the 17th and 18th centuries. These monasteries are rich in history, architecture, and spiritual significance. While some efforts have been made to preserve murals and digitize rare documents, there is no unified digital platform that offers tourists and researchers immersive access to these cultural treasures.

## Proposed Solution
**Monastery360: A Digital Heritage Platform for Sikkim’s Monasteries**

### Key Features
- **Virtual Tours:** 360° panoramic views of monastery interiors and surroundings.  
- **Narrated Walkthroughs:** Available in multiple languages.  
- **Interactive Map:** Geo-tagged monastery locations with travel routes and nearby attractions.  
- **Integration:** Local transport and tourism services.  
- **Digital Archives:** Scanned manuscripts, murals, and historical documents.  
- **AI-powered Search & Categorization** of monastery information.  
- **Smart Audio Guide App:** Location-based audio guides using Bluetooth beacons or GPS.  
- **Offline Mode:** Support for remote areas.  
- **Cultural Calendar:** Events, festivals, and rituals schedule.  
- **Booking & Participation:** Options for tourists to join events or tours.  

### Impact
- Boosts tourism by making monasteries more accessible.  
- Preserves endangered cultural assets digitally.  
- Empowers local communities through participatory archiving.  
- Supports educational and spiritual exploration globally.
