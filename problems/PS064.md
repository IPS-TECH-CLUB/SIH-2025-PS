# PS25004 â€“ Image Based Breed Recognition for Cattle and Buffaloes of India

## Background
The Government of India is implementing the **Bharat Pashudhan App (BPA)** for systematic data recording of breeding, health, and nutrition of dairy animals. Field Level Workers (FLWs) are responsible for capturing animal data on the ground. 

However, despite multiple training programs, a recurring issue is the **incorrect identification and registration of animal breeds** of cattle and buffaloes. This misclassification significantly affects the integrity and usability of the data for research, policy planning, and targeted interventions.

## Expected Solution
A solution that can **automatically recognize the breed of cattle and buffaloes** from images, ensuring accurate data capture for the BPA app.  

### Key Features (Suggested)
- **Image-based breed recognition** using computer vision / AI models.  
- Offline and mobile-friendly implementation for field-level use.  
- Integration with Bharat Pashudhan App for automated data validation.  
- Alerts for misclassified entries to FLWs for correction.  

### Impact
- Improves the accuracy of dairy animal data collection.  
- Supports research and policy planning with reliable breed information.  
- Reduces errors and manual corrections in the BPA system.
